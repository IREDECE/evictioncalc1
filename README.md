Hi, this page is the final project I made during the 10-week internship at the Eviction Lab! 
I'm really greatful for this opportunity and I learned a lot from this experience.

The project is an online calculator trying to estimate eviction in the aspect of:
Shelter Cost
Medical Cost
Children's Cost: including medical cost, foster care cost, juvenile delinquency cost
Encampment Cost

To use the calculator, please use this link:

Feel free to add comments in the doc if you think there's anything that can be improved. 

Thank you!
